Mass surveillance can be considered a characteristic feature of modern societies. Its importance is equaled only by the means put in place to collect and collect information. Among these means, the new surveillance and control technologies and above all the ways of deploying them raise a certain number of ethical issues which, in April 2008, were the subject of an opinion by the Ethics Commission of Science and Technology: Striking the Right Balance: An Ethical Look at New Surveillance and Control Technologies for Security Purposes.

The outline of the advisory and the technologies discussed therein are briefly presented.
