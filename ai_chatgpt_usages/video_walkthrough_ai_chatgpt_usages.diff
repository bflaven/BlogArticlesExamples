+ 1 + Two remarks on ChatGPT
First, asking Chat GPT about moral issues is pointless and sometimes ludicrous!

Second, still about the "corpus", as we do not know exactly the corpus of texts on which ChatGPT was trained to perfect its learning, it is certainly obvious that all the documentation relating to the development languages has been included (SQL, PHP, Python, JavaScript and so on... etc.) but that they do not necessarily integrate the latest developments.



+ 2 + How to detect plagiarism?
The idea naturally came because of using GPT chat https://chat.openai.com/ is how do we ensure that is has been made by a real person or by an IA?
Consequently, the massive use of GPT Chat or any other form of AI device necessarily brings its corollary of control which comes down to the following question: Is it a human who wrote all or part of the text or code that I have under the eyes?
