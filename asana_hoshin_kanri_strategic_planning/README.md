## Introduction

I released a book named “Learning and Building E2E test automation with Cypress & OKR – Define, Code & Apply an E2E strategy with Cypress & Objectives Key Results with PO mindset focus on Quality” at the beginning of this month December 2022.

To write the very first chapters, I had to focus on OKRs and the ability to build them for Q/A management.

**Here some code both in python and javascript in order to show on dashboard key figures on OKRs.**

## Git reminder

**In 2023, I always forget how to push on GitHub**

```bash
# GIT 2023

# get the remote directory if needed
git clone https://github.com/bflaven/book-learning-and-building-e2e-test-automation-with-cypress-and-okr.git


# hint: go to the directory
cd /Users/brunoflaven/Documents/03_git/BlogArticlesExamples/

# use the script to update
sh automate_commit.sh
 
# Create an empty Git repository or reinitialize an existing one
git init

# hint: know your branch
git branch


# hint: check for status
git status

# hint: for any change just type this command
git add .

# hint: add a commit with a message
git commit -am "remove repo"
git commit -am "add videos"
git commit -am "add repo"
git commit -am "add usecase"
git commit -am "add files"
git commit -am "add massive files"
git commit -am "update files"
git commit -am "update readme"
git commit -am "add repo and add readme"
git commit -am "add files and update readme"
git commit -am "add nft file examples in readme"

# hint: push to Github if your branch on Github is main
# git push origin main

# hint: push to Github if your branch on Github is master
git push origin master

# you can change GitHub in project's settings the name of the branch between master or main



```
