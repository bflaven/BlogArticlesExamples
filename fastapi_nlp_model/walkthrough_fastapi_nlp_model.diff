+ 009_streamlit_fastapi_basic_calculator:
A very simple, educational and hybrid project that demonstrate how-to create an API with FastAPI (backend) that will backed a web app made with Streamlit. Nice source of inspiration and a basic illustration of the FRONTEND, API, MODEL workflow.


+ 011_cookiecutter_spacy_fastapi:
I only grab the API and the test (pytest) from this project. In reality, it is a bit more extended project, made by Microsoft's people to promote Azure platform, using cookiecutter. Here is the full description of the initial project: "A python cookiecutter API for quick deployments of spaCy models with FastAPI. The API interface is compatible with Azure Search Cognitive Skills."



+ 017_chatGPT_fastapi_nlp_model:
I already mention this POC. The files are a mix between logical code written by ChatGPT (I have given the prompt in the main.py) and then extended by myself with the code grabbed during this exploration. The API has serve as a base for a presentation to expose ML app build & deployment in my company. It illustrate my belief "A pseudo product must always exist to become the very subject of discussion".
