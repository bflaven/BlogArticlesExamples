# collapsible-tree-javascript-diagram

Play with this interactive JavaScript chart here: http://jennyknuth.github.io/collapsible-tree-javascript-diagram/

This diagram takes the work of coodict's "JavaScript in one pic" found here: 
https://github.com/coodict/javascript-in-one-pic, and puts it into a collapsible tree format using d3.js by Mike Bostock, found here:
http://bl.ocks.org/mbostock/4339083.

I liked the idea of being able to interact with the complicated tree diagram, to expand and contract it at will
in order to explore its different branches.
