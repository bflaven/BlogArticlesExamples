Here is a list of some of the categories commonly used by Google Trends:

These categories encompass a wide range of topics and industries. Please note that Google Trends also allows you to search for specific keywords or phrases to explore their search popularity and related data. Additionally, Google Trends may have expanded its category list since my knowledge cutoff, so you can visit the Google Trends website for the most up-to-date information.
