Because it gives a chance for others than seasoned developers to query GT! The purpose was to explore the Google Trends abilities to summon editorial POV for some journalists in despair. *Some said that it is a crystal ball some for topics some other pretend that is the cultural globalisation living proof.* **Well, it is both! More pragmatically this is P.O.C to provide guidelines for a future SEO dashboard.** \n\n *The explanations came from this post: https://practicaldatascience.co.uk/data-science/how-to-analyse-search-traffic-using-the-google-trends-api*\n\n *If you want to check out directly Google Trends, you can at this URL: https://trends.google.com*"

# trending_searches
GREAT_EXPANDER_TEXT_1 = "EXAMPLE_1 :: Top Searches (`trending_searches()`) :: The `trending_searches()` function returns a dataframe containing the current most popular searches being entered on Google. By default, if you pass in no arguments trending_searches() returns the top global searches."


# build_payload
GREAT_EXPANDER_TEXT_2 = "EXAMPLE_2 :: Interest over time (`interest_over_time()`) :: The `interest_over_time()` can help you to examine and chart the interest of specific search queries over time you can use the `interest_over_time()` function. To use this you initially need to build a PyTrends payload with `build_payload()`, which takes a list of search terms available in the variable `keywords()`. It will return the search volume for each time period and each term in a Pandas dataframe."

GREAT_EXPANDER_TEXT_3 = "EXAMPLE_3 :: YouTube trends (`interest_over_time()`) :: With the `interest_over_time()`, you can also run Google Trends searches on other Google properties, besides the default Google search. For instance, let's take a look at YouTube searches with `gprop='youtube'` for `IA` and `journalism` to see how demand differs and whether thereâ€™s any seasonality."
