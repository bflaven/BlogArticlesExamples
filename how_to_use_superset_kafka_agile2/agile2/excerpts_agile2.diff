"At some point, a project must produce a final product."

+ Planning, Transition & Transformation
- Any initiative requires both a vision or goal, and a flexible, steerable, outcome-oriented plan.

- Any significant transformation is mostly a learning journey – not merely a process change.

- Product development is mostly a learning journey – not merely an “implementation.”

+ Product, Portfolio & Stakeholders
- Obtain feedback from the market and stakeholders continuously.
- Work iteratively in small batches.
- The only proof of value is a business outcome.
- Organizations need an “inception framework” tailored to their needs.
- Create documentation to share and deepen understanding.

+ Continuous Improvement
- Place limits on things that cause drag.
- Integrate early and often.
