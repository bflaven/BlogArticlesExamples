# setup_js_env_2

The idea is to easily handle a more advanced javascript development environment with Node.


```bash

# The idea is to load an html file
cd /Users/brunoflaven/Documents/03_git/BlogArticlesExamples/migration_codeceptjs_to_cypress_write_javascript_class/



# check the install
node -v
npm -v



# Step_2 create and go to the dir
mkdir setup_js_env_2
cd setup_js_env_2/
# to launch directly the project in vs code
code .



# Step_2a: create folder for source files called "src"
cd setup_js_env_2/
mkdir src
# src/ will contain all your "source files" and it will all be compiled to a single production file later using webpack.



# Step_2b: create another folder called "dist"
cd setup_js_env_2/
mkdir dist
# dist/ will contain all your "production files". The files inside this folder are generated by webpack.







# Step_4: create the file index.html in the dist folder
cd dist/
touch index.html


# Step_5: cut and paste in index.html
<!-- the code of an html page -->
&lt;html&gt;
   &lt;head&gt;
     &lt;title&gt;Tutorial&lt;/title&gt;
   &lt;/head&gt;
   &lt;body&gt;
     &lt;h1&gt;Welcome&lt;/h1&gt;
       &lt;p&gt;
          This is index page...
       &lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;/body&gt;
&lt;/html&gt;



# Step_6: go to the dist
cd dist/
touch index.js


# Step_7: install webpack and babel

cd /Users/brunoflaven/Documents/01_work/blog_articles/write_javascript_class/setup_js_env_2/

npm install -–save-dev webpack webpack-cli webpack-dev-server babel-loader babel-core babel-preset-env 


# Step_7: configure webpack

# create the file "webpack.config.js" on the root of the project and paste the following code.
touch webpack.config.js



# Step_8: create babel configuration file.

# create a .babelrc config in your project root and the paste the following
touch .babelrc


# Step_9 add the key "private" under "description" and set its value to "true"
"private":true,



# Step_10 remove the line
"main": "index.js",


# example
{
  "name": "setup_js_env_2",
  "version": "1.0.0",
  "description": "A setup_js_env_2 to develop locally some javascript",
  "private": true,
  "main": "index.js",
  "scripts": {

    "watch": "webpack --watch --mode=development",
    "start": "webpack-dev-server --mode=development --open"
  },

    "node",
    "javascript",
    "console",
    "chrome"
  ],
  "author": "bflaven",
  "license": "ISC",
  "dependencies": {
    "babel-core": "^6.26.3",
    "babel-loader": "^8.2.4",
    "babel-preset-env": "^1.7.0",
    "webpack": "^5.72.0",

}



npm run start

# This command will start the web server, open a tab in your default browser.
# If you make any changes in your source files — files in the "src" folder, webpack will automatically rebuild the code and reload your browser.



# If you want to build the source only once, use "npm run build" instead.
npm run build
npm run watch


# Step_11 start the web server, you are done....

npm start

```
