+ What is unit testing?
Unit testing is a type of software testing where each individual component of the system is tested. Unit testing is important practice for the developers. It ensures that every component of the software is functioning appropriately as expected. Unit testing is mainly performed by the developers during the coding phase of the software development.

Unit testing makes it easy to fix the problems as the developers come to know which particular component of the system or software has the issues and the developers can fix that particular unit.

Let's create simple functions in a file named calc.py


# calc.py
def addition(x, y):
     return x + y
def subtraction(x, y):
     return x-y
def multiplication(x, y):
     return x * y
def division(x, y):
     return x / y


   
Let's unit test this file : calc.py with the following files

test_calc.py or calc_test.py; both are good naming conventions.
