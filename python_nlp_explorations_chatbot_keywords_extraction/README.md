# python_nlp_explorations_chatbot_keywords_extraction

After facial recognition, I am tackling language issues with Python. Indeed, after image, the other ingredient for a post is mostly text! As a CMS “manufacturer” or PO, I was wondering what advantages I can withdraw from NLP. Concretely, it means exploring and learning Python to improve both user support (FAQs turn as a Chatbot, analyzing User Feedback…) but also think about some editorial features especially with the help of Natural Language Processing (NLP).


**Chronologically, the very first library, I explored was the famous NLPs librairie, NTLK. Then I discovered Pytorch, made by Facebook and then Spacy. There will be certainly a more specific article on Spacy because I really like Spacy for its accessibility both in tutorials and in its core values. After all this reading, I selected few articles that were illustrating, at least, some of my personal interests for NLP. This post is a quick overview of that exploration.**
