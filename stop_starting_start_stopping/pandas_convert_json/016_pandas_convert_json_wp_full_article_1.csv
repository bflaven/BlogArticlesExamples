32,"Imagemagick, Docker, DevOps &#8211; Bulk processing images with Imagemagick and Docker, DevOps solution. A quick comparison with Photoshop scripts, Craft solution.",1,"<p>Using a Docker &#038; Imagemagick bundle to replace Photoshop for resizing and optimizing bunch of images is not totally irrelevant. Why that? Besides the fact that It gave you the insurance to execute properly a repetitive task, it has several benefits that I listed. I am not talking about an advanced usage made, for instance, by a web designer. The subject of this post is managing thousand of images, that is key in a digital workflow. This is one of the most time-consuming charges in the content creation workload. On my own, I made a real Spike on that subject!</p>

<p>For those who ignore what a Spike in Scrum? Here is a quick definition:<br />
<i>&#8220;Spikes are an invention of Extreme Programming (XP), are a special type of user story that is used to gain the knowledge necessary to reduce the risk of a technical approach, better understand a requirement, or increase the reliability of a story estimate. A spike has a maximum time-box size as the sprint it is contained in it. At the end of a sprint, the spike will be determined that is done or not-done just like any other ordinary user story. A Spike is a great way to mitigate risks early and allows the team ascertain feedback and develop an understanding on an upcoming PBI’s complexity.&#8221;</i></p>

<p><b>Some benefits to move from Photoshop to Docker/Imagemagick.</b></p>
<ul>
<li><b>Image quality:</b> no trade-off with image quality and reducing time-consuming task to work on image.</li>
<li><b>Docker:</b> good empiric introduction to automation, industrialization, CI, with a sharable and maintainable environment.</li>
<li><b>Open Source:</b> imagemagick, Docker are free. It is saving money and time, less training, no licensing. There is only the learning curb that may cost you time. No Pain No Gain!</li>
<li><b>User-Experience:</b> above all saving time to work for the editorial team, time to write and think. Same usages allow better support.</li>
<li><b>Textbook case</b> It is a pragmatic textbook case to show progress from craft usage to industrial usage and how Docker can help you in that?</li>
</ul>
<p>So, how can batch image processing can reduce this creation process from hours to just a few simple clicks? For this tedious task, why don&#8217;t we try to replace Photoshop by a bundle with Imagemagick &#038; Docker? This is the subject of this post. </p>
<p><b>The user story will be: As an editor, journalist, contributor, I focus only on the image editorial choice and with the help of a bulk processing, a script runs to convert the images into the right format for publishing.I had always this idea somewhere in my mind to leverage on Imagemagick and Docker to batch this image treatment an give a workable alternative to Photoshop.</b></p>
<p><b>In my github, you will find even more, a tiny manual written when I was in Zambia, 3 additional use cases and a bunch of Youtube video. I am not cheating you!</b></p>

<h2>Looking for the perfect Docker image with Imagemagick</h2>
<p>Inevitably other people, more experienced in development than I am, thought about this topic. So, my sole quest was to pull a docker image that already exist containing Imagemagick. </p>
<p>This docker image will be the &#8220;base&#8221; for industrialization work for resizing and optimization images. This is also a &#8220;killing two birds with one stone&#8221; operation as it will de facto standardize usages and practices for any member of the editorial team and ease the support pain.</p>
<p>This is a very simple decision criterion which militates for the choice of the Docker and Imagemagick tandem. This criterion is very simple, imagine that you must equip each computer with a Photoshop license or any software and possibly provide training, in short, this is inflation guaranteed.</p>
<p>Another advantage, using the Docker and Imagemagick tandem will prevent you from buying, installing, training and support each user with a specific software like Photoshop or Gimp even though Gimp is free. A true nightmare.</p>
<p>However, let&#8217;s go back to the original need: preparing images for a web or mobile publication, it is mainly to select and then resize the image that match editorially with your content and fit you applications (website, mobile application&#8230;).</p>
<p>In a practical way, working images is essentially to export images at the right settings (72 dpi, format 16/9 or 4/3, correct filename&#8230;) and the rest we do not give a f&#8230;</p>
<p>Implementing D&#038;I (Docker &#038; Imagemagick) will accidentally also cut down the whining refrains from anyone such as &#8220;My computer is too slow&#8221;, &#8220;I am not trained&#8221;, &#8220;I do not have the license&#8221;, &#8220;Selecting image is part of my job but not the resizing and the optimizing&#8221;&#8230; so many popular refrains whose intensity is multiplied by ten due to lockdown.</p>
<p><b>Listing the benefits can only motivate you to adopt this solution. By the way, you can pretend it is DevOps but at the very first place, it is common sense.</b></p>
<p>Frankly, I do not understand why on both side there is so much misunderstanding. I am about to believe that people are &#8220;stupid&#8221; when they reach their point incompetence? </p>
<p><b>On one side, DevOps do not think about such evolution. Maybe because they ignore everything on content creation workflow. On the other side, Editorial team do not dare to ask for such tool because they basically ignore that there is a possible alternative to Photoshop for instance. Anyway, no collaboration, no smart evolution, just an incredible mess that generate endless errors and support tickets! What a waste of time!</b></p>
<p><b>Lockdown spotlight with cruelty the lack of common understanding. You may find this conclusion bitter but unfortunately it seems to be true.</b></p>
<p>I quote this post in my sister&#8217;s blog that summarize this impression during the lockdown.</p>
<p>&#8220;Another thing also jumps out at us: the amazing social uselessness of certain professions. Marketer, advisor, financier, manager, and so on. When I think that we have not even realized that these auxiliary services of our sophisticated economy were at a standstill. Neoliberalism will therefore have succeeded where communism had failed: employing lots of people to do unnecessary things!&#8221;</p>

<p><b>Like said Peter Drucker: &#8220;There is surely nothing quite so useless as doing with great efficiency what should not be done at all.&#8221;</b></p>
<p><b>Time to think is over, no kidding!</b></p>
<h2>Using the Docker image with Imagemagick</h2>
<p>These are the main commands for exploring Imagemagick and Docker. Don&#8217;t forget to start Docker before.</p>
<p><b>1. Install Imagemagick and Docker</b></p>
<pre lang=""bash"">
# launch the console
cd /Volumes/mi_disco/imagemagick_docker_1
# make a docker pull from this distribution
docker pull dpokidov/imagemagick

# create the environment
cd /Volumes/mi_disco/imagemagick_docker_1/

# create the source and destination folders for your batch image processing
make 01_source_images
make 02_destination_images

# I have these 2 directories on a remote disk
# /Volumes/mi_disco/imagemagick_docker_1/01_source_images
# /Volumes/mi_disco/imagemagick_docker_1/02_destination_images
</pre>
<h2>Playing with Imagemagick and Docker</h2>
<p><b>1. resize with -resize 100&#215;100 that force to resize</b></p>
<pre lang=""bash"">

</pre>
<p><b>Conclusion: Indeed, it is a strong move and a bold decision to go for Imagemagick &#038; Docker (I &#038; D). First, it does NOT mean that you have to renounce to Photoshop. Just focus on cracking down in micro tasks your conditioning images working workflow and expel most boring, tedious and repetitive actions to this I &#038; D environment using programming to perform its.<br />
Last but not least, it supposes also that the DevOps you are working with have understood your automation needs that is may be the most difficult part of the program!</b></p>

30,"Hack, WordPress – A quick introduction to diagnose, restore and protect a hacked WordPress",1,"<p>I do mainly today mobile applications but I have still few websites running on WP and I have worked with WordPress since a long time. It is an easy, nice and economic way to make a website or even to run an API for a mobile application. Mostly because WordPress is very simple to take in hand for newbies.</p>
<p><b>The drawback of WordPress is the extreme vulnerability of the CMS to hacking. If you possesses a WP in production, be sure to look after it, making the required updates especially both for themes, plugins and the core code. If not, soon your site will be vulnerable and an easy prey for hackers even the most novice ones.</b></p>
<p>Is it the approach of Christmas Time or the end of the year? Some hackers made me a present : they have brutally hacked one of the WP site that I have installed long time ago.</p>
<p>Who to blame ? No-one, expect me, the site owner or both of us. Indeed, the updates have been not been made properly, nothing has been really made to secure the installation&#8230; I know few people who are managing web servers that I have a word for WP that is relegated to a noxious plague known as WordPox. There is also some sexist and delicate designations for WP, known as &#8220;pute digitale&#8221; or the more scatological  &#8220;pezzo di merda secca digitale&#8221;. Anyway something that is turning around the concept of digital whore that seems accessible to anyone but with a very high risk on contamination. Oooops.<br />
Indeed, this is outrageously sexist and inaccurate towards WP if you intend to take some prophylactic measures, that we will see in a couple of lines below.</p>
<p>Anyway, the very first reaction when your site is hacked is that you feel sorry not to have been more cautious. When, you check the website from codex.wordpress.org, the first advice is pretty simple and quite wisely too.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><b>Stay calm.</b></p>
<p>When addressing a security issue, as a website owner, you&#8217;re likely experiencing an undue amount of stress. It&#8217;s often the most vulnerable you have found yourself since being on line and it&#8217;s contrary to what every one told you, &#8220;Hey, WordPress is Easy!!&#8221;</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Apart from being calm, I was wondering what kind of venereal disease or I&#8217;d rather what kind of &#8220;French disease&#8221; the WordPress installation  has contracted.</p>
<h4>What kind of hack is that?</h4>
<p>Just find this weird injection at the beginning of the wp-config.php file&#8230;. Ugly, is that serious Doctor ?<br />

<h4>What can I do?</h4>
<p><b>Here is a quick TodoList of what you imperatively need to do if your WP has been hacked</b></p>
<ul>
<li>Save the wp-config.php file, your images, and your personal files one by one (not the folder as it may contain unwanted files).</li>
<li>Make sure that there is no malicious code in the saved wp-config.php file.</li>
<li>Wipe out the entire folder where WordPress is installed.</li>
<li>Upload a new clean full package of the latest WordPress version.</li>
<li>Re-upload your wp-config.php file and images.</li>
<li>Re-install the latest versions of your plugins and themes.</li>
<li>Change the passwords for all WordPress admin users. Please use passwords that are hard to guess.</li>
<li>Change the hosting Control Panel password and all MySQL passwords.</li>
</ul>
<p><b>Some kind of SQL queries that will help to check the content of your database if there's been some damages.</b></p>
<pre lang=""sql"" escaped=""true"">
SELECT * FROM wp_posts WHERE post_content LIKE '%&lt;iframe%'

<h4>Main security measures you can do or not...</h4>
<p>Roughly, protecting WP consist of spreading Htaccess files everywhere! Htaccess files will help control the way visitors can interact with your website. The htaccess file is also used to block specific traffic from being able to view your website.</p>
<p><b>1. Modify the existing .htaccess of WP</b><br />
The idea is to protect more carefully the access to some core files of WordPress eg wp-config.php, the .htaccess itself, prevent listing for directories...etc. You just have to modify the existing .htaccess of WP.</p>
<p><b>2. Add your own .htaccess for /wp-admin/</b><br />
A second .htpasswd will be created to also secure more efficiently the administration dashboard </p>
<p><b>Be sure sure to place the .htpasswd, not in the root directory</b></p>
<p><b>3. Create the file .htpasswd and add the user <i>mysuperuser</i></b></p>
<pre lang=""bash"">htpasswd -c /[path-to-your-htpasswd-file]/.htpasswd mysuperuser</pre>
<p>If you don't current have an .htpasswd, use the ""-c"" option to create the file with the first user. It will prompt you for a password and encrypt it for you.</p>
<p><b>Command to list the files including the .htpasswd</b></p>
<pre lang=""bash"">ls -la</pre>
<p>If you already have the .htpasswd file and would like to append a new user, repeat the command with the ""-c"".</p>
<p><b>Command to add a new user</b></p>
<pre lang=""bash"">htpasswd -c /[path-to-your-htpasswd-file]/.htpasswd mysuperuser2</pre>
<h4>Find the real path for your WP installation</h4>
<p>In order to get the real path to your WordPress installation send a php file with the following command inside at the root directory of your installation.</p>
<pre lang=""php"">
echo (''.getcwd().'');
</pre>
<p><b>You will get printed probably something like this, depending your hosting service.</b><br />
<code>/home/[user-account-or-ftp-user-account]/www</code></p>
<p><b>Create the <code>.htpasswd</code> file and add a new user named <code>mysuperuser</code></b><br />

<h4>Scanning the files of your previous WP</h4>
<p>As you have made a fresh and new installation as you may need to re-upload some of the existing files from your previous WP eg uploads directory, plugins, themes...</p>
<p><b>I strongly advised you to scan these files that are probably infected, with malware more discrete, so you need to find and destroy it. These files are potential threats for your new WP such as backdoors, code injections, malicious iframes, hidden eval code, the the base64 family:<code>base64_decode, gzinflate(base64_decode, eval(gzinflate(base64_decode, eval(base64_decode...</code> and more. We have used for this task one of the most popular plugin named wordfence</b></p>
<p><b>Wisely, I have runned the plugin <code>wordfence</code> locally before uploading the all stuff on the new WP installation and guess what I found a bunch of crap installed by a hacker in order to perform malicious activity.</b></p>
<p><b>Launching the scan, being locally accelerated the scan process.</b><br />

28,"Using Ludwig, Introduction to Deep Learning",1,"<p>As a PO, I always try to find out some way to increase productivity but above all is to avoid doing repeatedly boring stuff! So, it often happens that I am writing code for my own use to avoid tedious work or even the work itself!</p>
<p>I am currently working on Python and try to sneak out practical results quickly with the help of ML, NLP or IA. As I read a lot of stuff about IA, I incidentally discovered Ludwig! So, this post is my personal tchotchkes&#8217; collection on Ludwig. </p>
<p>My feeling was that the more I was reading about Ludwig, the more it maybe the right tool for me! Curiosity for IA but laziness and reluctancy for theoretical explanations and coding. Anyway, enough pointless personal considerations, let&#8217;s introduce Ludwig and then use it to train, predict and visualize!</p>
<ul>
<li><b>All the files shown in the 3 videos can be found here: <a href=""https://github.com/bflaven/BlogArticlesExamples/tree/master/using_ludwig_introduction_to_deep_learning"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener"">https://github.com/bflaven/BlogArticlesExamples/tree/master/using_ludwig_introduction_to_deep_learning</a></b></li>
</ul>
<h3>1. What is Ludwig? </h3>
<p><b>Ludwig is a code free deep-learning tool box</b>. It is supported by a Uber research scientist named Piero Molino. Ludwig lets people without a machine learning background train prediction models without the need to write code. </p>
<p>Ludwig can help you make deep learning easier to understand for non-experts and enable faster model improvement iteration cycles for experienced machine learning developers and researchers alike. </p>
<p>Ludwig is a good starting to cover many ML use cases. It has:</p>
<ul>
<li><b>flexibility:</b> expert users and novices can take advantage of Ludwig.</li>
<li><b>extensibility:</b> really easy to add additional model to Ludwig.<b></b></li>
</ul>
<p>Ludwig make the model understandable at least in terms of what is predicting and what is the quality of the predictions.</p>
<p>It streamlines the ML process and assists you in all the workflow: splits the data in training, validation, and test sets, trains the model on the training set, validates on the validation set (early stopping), predicts on the test set&#8230; and so on.</p>
<p>You really have only set the output feature and the input feature and define the data type abstraction or a model definition without coding because it is all in .yml file.</p>
<p><b>The real issue that you may encounter is really to understand what you are currently doing if you are not familiar with ML. Like me, in the past, I have mostly used pretrained models so I am not aware of all the model’s subtleties and the way to fine tune a model! What a schmock!</b></p>
<p>There are plenty of examples on the official documentation at <a href=""https://ludwig-ai.github.io/ludwig-docs/examples/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener"">https://ludwig-ai.github.io/ludwig-docs/examples/</a></p>
<h3>2. Install LUDWIG</h3>

</pre>
<p><b>If it is all done! You are good, you are ready to go and be part of the IA revolution and add some wow to your professional life at least.</b></p>
<h3>3. Using LUDWIG</h3>
<p>Here is a quick memo on important notions that you may often encounter if you get to grip with AI or Deep learning.</p>
<p><b>3.1 Few definitions: epoch, batch, dataset&#8230;</b><br />
<b>That an extract of the most simple answer about &#8220;What is an epoch?&#8221; extracted from <a href=""https://www.quora.com/What-is-an-epoch-in-deep-learning"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener"">https://www.quora.com/What-is-an-epoch-in-deep-learning</a></b></p>
<ul>
<li>Deep learning often deals with copious amounts of data.</li>
<li>This data is broken down into smaller chunks (called <b>batches</b>) and fed to the neural networks one-by-one.</li>
<li>One <b>epoch</b> is when the entire <b>dataset</b> is passed forward and backward through the neural network once.</li>
<li>In order to generalize the model, there is more than one <b>epoch</b> in the majority of the deep learning models.</li>
<li>The more the number of <b>epochs</b>, the more the parameters are adjusted thus resulting in a better performing model. However, too many epochs might lead to <b>overfitting</b>. If a model is overfitted, it does well in the train data and performs poorly on the test data.</li>
<li><b>Iteration</b> is the number of <b>batches</b> needed to complete one <b>epoch</b>.</li>
</ul>
<p><b>A simple example to understand the linking between all these notions.</b><br />
Suppose we have a dataset of 42,000 training examples and we divide it into batches of 600. To complete 1 epoch, it would have taken 70 (42,000 divided by 600) iterations.</p>
<p><b>3.2 Must-knows on Ludwig</b></p>
<p><b>3.2.1 requirements for ludwig, batches</b><br />
You do not need to code to test training models. What is required by Ludwig is input and output? Input: You need to have dataset in .csv format as an input plus a declarative model definition (YAML).</p>
<p><b>3.2.2 Under the hood: where are the files that matters 🙂</b></p>
<p><b>After the first training in the main folder</b><br />
Running Ludwig will create 2 files in the main folder: </p>
<ol>
<li>The file with .meta.json&#8217;s extension will contain the mapping.</li>
<li>The file with .hdf5&#8217;s extension will contain the data.</li>
</ol>
<p><b>After each training in the results folder</b><br />
&#8211; In <code>/results/experiment_run/description.json</code>: Like it is indicated by the name, you have all the meta information about the command so the file description.json  that contains all the information on how the command was run, what was the input feature and the output feature &#8230;.</p>
<p>&#8211; In <code>/results/experiment_run/training_statistics.json</code>: the file contains basic stats on what is accuracy, loss&#8230; etc. of your model</p>
<p>&#8211; If you want to use model for a prediction, you just have to point to the model directory e.g <code>/results/experiment_run_3/model</code></p>
<h3>4. EXTRAS STUFF</h3>
<p>&#8211; You can also visualize to compare models among them with the <code>visualize</code> command.</p>
<p>&#8211; There is also a Programmatic API that can be used directly in python script like any python library. Check <a href=""https://ludwig-ai.github.io/ludwig-docs/api/LudwigModel/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener"">https://ludwig-ai.github.io/ludwig-docs/api/LudwigModel/</a></p>
<h3>5. Videos tutorials on Ludwig</h3>
<p><b>3 videos with some little mistakes but that gave a good sense of what is Ludwig and how to use if your are not an expert!</b></p>
<ol>

<li><a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dvYjpeFOk3Q"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener"">Using Ludwig, Introduction to Deep Learning &#8211; Predicting a passenger&#8217;s surviving probability to the Titanic disaster with Ludwig</a></li>
</ol>
<h3>Conclusion</h3>
<p>Well, the very first Ludwig’s benefit is psychologic! Ludwig lowers the supposed high entry barriers to concepts such as Deep learning, Machine Learning, Artificial Intelligence or Visualization. So, like me, if you are a P.O, a project manager, a marketing guy, you may feel, by discovering Ludwig, a little bit the meaning of what is the Artificial Intelligence revolution is about&#8230;<br />
I must agree that it does not turn you magically into a data scientist in one night! The proof is that you may find explanations in my videos a bit shaky or even ludicrous.<br />
Nevertheless, that is a great opportunity to leave pre-trained models to experiment your own models. &#8220;Don&#8217;t think you&#8217;re so small, you&#8217;re not so tall&#8221;! like the Talmud says.</p>

26,"Doing more effective work and less coding, videos retrieving&#8217;s dilemma fixed with a 2 hours WP plugin work.",1,"<p>I wanted to integrate some of the videos released since the very first lockdown on YouTube. At the least, the best I can do, it is simply publishing these personal videos to increase: brand awareness, SERP, SEO&#8230;</p>
<p>Unfortunately, due to some security issues, I cannot inflate my personal YouTube channel with numerous videos that I made professionally so it may increase the anemic number of views 🙂</p>
<p>You do not have to be a brilliant expert to know that Google Search Engine has taken note that videos are being among the most effective content types to reach and engage audience.</p>
<p>I was wondering how to proceed with the minimum of work! Efficiency with less waste possible was my objective and without butchering the job!</p>
<p>I started with a project based on JSON youtube API Calls and it end up with a WordPress Plugin made up in more or less 2 hours.<br />
Well, there is several explanations to the mutation:</p>
<ol>
<li>I have unemployed plugin source code for quotes that was easily converted to videos management. Massive replacement is key, just check the readme on Github.
<li>Leveraging on YT API was a potentiality but it means that most of the work was dedicated to coding and not to content management itself, smooth integration and user experience inside WordPress as I am running my own theme named Zaatar.</li>
</ol>
<p>For these 2 main reasons, I decided to go for a simple WP plugin. You can find more information on the readme on the GitHub directory.<br />
There is a third reason, I start to have a keen interest on Python but it is no help in dealing with my WP blog!</p>
<p><b>One last word&#8230;</b><br />
I know it is a &#8220;cheap&#8221; post but after all that the purpose of this blog to keep track of what was one of my preoccupations for the last week. It is also to save some works (files essentially) on GitHub instead of deleting its when the job is done.</p>
<p>Also, having the plugin installed online forced me to rework the design video output as the result was at first very ugly. So, some editorial ideas came out&#8230; It reminds me that issuing quickly the feature is always better than keep it until it is supposed to be perfect and most of the work was indeed on look and feel and content.</p>

24,Fake News Detection in Python using Natural language processing &#8211; Can applied computing help a journalist in automatic fact-checking?,1,"<p>As the US has elected a new president, I found interesting to write an article on fake news, a real Trump&#8217;s era sign of the time.</p>
<p>In the recent past, I already made some experiment to help journalists to enable factchecking. This post is available on this blog and a very basic WP plugin code that help to FactCheck was released too. You can check @ <b>ClaimReview, Fact Check – Using ClaimReview structured data element to Fact Check articles and build a WordPress plugin for it</b><br /><a href=""http://flaven.fr/2018/12/claimreview-fact-check-using-claimreview-structured-data-element-to-fact-check-articles-and-build-a-wordpress-plugin-for-it/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener"">http://flaven.fr/2018/12/claimreview-fact-check-using-claimreview-structured-data-element-to-fact-check-articles-and-build-a-wordpress-plugin-for-it/</a></p>
<p>But, due to the increasing fake news number, manually factchecking any new is preposterous and seems as obsolete as the sundial. It is like &#8220;emptying the sea with a spoon&#8221;. That&#8217;s remind me the ancient usage controversy between search engine (Google) and links catalogue (Yahoo) in the 2000&#8217;s where the links&#8217; inflation ruined at least Yahoo and made Google&#8217;s fortune. You cannot defeat figures.</p>
<p>I guess that fake news phenomenon is so important nowadays that you have to find a way to delegate indexation and analysis of fake news to computers and not to humans.</p>
<p><b>As I am learning NLP (Natural Language Processing), I was asking myself: &#8220;Does NLP can come to the rescue to unmask these &#8220;mother fakers&#8221; behind this modern plague?&#8221;. Apparently yes, I found a set of articles dealing with that issue.</b></p>
<p>Recently, either you are living on Planet Mars but you cannot ignore conspirators, paranoiacs from all kind that are producing and consuming fake news. <b>People who truly believe that even the tiniest things do have great political significance, and everything they thought might that be true actually is ! That&#8217;s freaking!</b><br />
It is not just being righteous, arrogant and condescending to tell people how they ought to behave, how they should stop being so credulous and thinking so much against their own interests!</p>
<p>Anyway, investigating on this issue has given me the occasion to encounter some funny comments like this one &#8220;Too much Trump in the dataset&#8221; 🙂</p>
<p>I have selected almost 2 identical posts but I decided to go randomly with the code of the first post.</p>
<p>What amused me, it is that with few lines of code you can dig quickly and get some results in understanding how NLP (Natural Language Processing) can help you out in predicting fake news from news headlines! I didn&#8217;t dare applying this try to a news dataset coming from the medias I am working with! I&#8217;m probably too wimpy or too cautious to do so but that&#8217;s another question.</p>

<h3>Fake news detection with python &#8211; the environment</h3>
<p>In practice, fake news detection required the install of a tremendous number of python librairies such as : nltk, seaborn, wordcloud, PIL, BeautifulSoup, sklearn, keras, tensorflow&#8230; etc.</p>
<p>In several previous blog posts, I explained how to perform these installations either with Anaconda or Pip. What work for me was mainly Pip and that&#8217;s all. Here is below a quick reminder to perform the install through the Mac console.</p>
<p><b>The command to install the librairies</b></p>
<pre lang=""bash"">
# to install tensorflow and keras
# be careful tensorflow and keras require a lot of space disk 
pip install tensorflow
pip install keras

# I guess you can run the same command pip install [library_name] to install
# the following librairies : nltk, seaborn, wordcloud, PIL, BeautifulSoup, sklearn, keras, tensorflow... etc.

</pre>
<h3>Not a jupyter notebook, just a simple python script with comments</h3>
<p>About the jupyter notebook, I am not really fond of jupyter notebook, I&#8217;d rather user standard python file to discover and execute script. I know jupyter notebook is made for true educational purpose but I prefer the logic of the code exposed in a script! So for both of these 2 articles that I have selected that are by the way almost identical, I converted the jupyter notebook (.ipynb) file into a standard python script (.py) and slightly rewrite the script to underline the script main steps. Anyway, I keep track on how to launch a Jupyter Notebook for the record.</p>
<p><b>How to launch  a Jupyter Notebook App on a mac</b></p>
<ol>
<li>Click on spotlight, type terminal to open a terminal window.</li>
<li>Enter the startup folder by typing cd /some_folder_name.
<pre lang=""bash"">cd /Users/brunoflaven/Documents/02_copy/_000_IA_bruno_light/article_bert_detecting_fake_news_1/fake-news-nlp-master/</pre>
</li>
<li>Type <code>jupyter notebook</code> to launch the Jupyter Notebook App e.g fake-news-nlp-master_2.ipynb The notebook interface will appear in a new browser window or tab then you just click on the *.ipynb
<pre lang=""bash"">jupyter notebook</pre>
</li>
</ol>
<p><i>Source: <a href=""https://jupyter-notebook-beginner-guide.readthedocs.io/en/latest/execute.html"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener"">https://jupyter-notebook-beginner-guide.readthedocs.io/en/latest/execute.html</a></i></p>
<h3>Light changes in the python script</h3>
<p>Here are the light changes I made to make it understandable and easier to use:</p>
<p>1. I have reduced the sample just because my mac is almost dying when I am loading the dataset.</p>
<pre lang=""python"">
# Import our data

# an insignificant dataset with 3 records
# true = pd.read_csv(""TrueSmallSample.csv"")
# fake = pd.read_csv(""FakeSmallSample.csv"")

# a medium dataset with 90 records
true = pd.read_csv(""TrueMediumSample.csv"")
fake = pd.read_csv(""FakeMediumSample.csv"")

# the complete dataset
# true = pd.read_csv(""TrueBigSample.csv"")
# fake = pd.read_csv(""FakeBigSample.csv"")
</pre>
<p>2. I’d rather save image files than show it. Why? First to preserve my mac, at the same time I am working.. so I don&#8217;t want my mac to turn as a zombie. Second, I don’t like when the script flow is interrupted by image generation.</p>
<pre lang=""python"">
# PICTURE_3 OUTPUT
"""""" Article Subjects By Type """"""
plt.figure(figsize=(16, 9))
sns.countplot(x='subject', hue='category', data=df)
plt.title('Article Subjects By Type', fontsize=24)
plt.ylabel('Total', fontsize=16)
plt.xlabel('')
plt.xticks(fontsize=12)
plt.legend(['Fake', 'Real'])
# plt.show()
plt.savefig('picture_3_article_subjects_by_type.png')
print(""\n--- # PICTURE_3 OUTPUT "")
</pre>
<p>3. I print significant results inside the console every time, it is meaningful like in a kind jupyter notebook&#8230; e.g. # PICTURE_3 OUTPUT I know it may sound contradictory but the jupyter notebook is too CPU intensive. </p>
<pre lang=""python"">
# Let's explore the data at a base level

sample_true = true.sample(20)
sample_fake = fake.sample(20)

print(""\n--- sample_true only 20"")
print (sample_true)
print(""\n--- sample_true only 20"")
print(sample_fake)
</pre>
<p><b>Conclusion:</b></p>
<p>Well with only few searches, and a very fresh understanding of NLP, I was able to find some basic scripts that are supposed to help me detect Fake News. Indeed, Fake News blossomed everywhere and constantly in digital media and social networks. It is one of the symptoms of the scary Post-truth phenomenon. Just think for a minute about the news &#8220;bullshitt&#8221; talking about the COVID-19, the vaccine or some social issues.</p>
<p>For sure, detecting fake news may become increasingly necessary and due to the volume why don&#8217;t we apply Artificial Intelligence (AI) and, more specifically Natural Language Processing (NLP). I guess, it will be required for future journalists to manipulate more advanced tools to detect Fake News like they already learn how to make video shooting with mobile for social networks!</p>
<p>Well, ok fine, another tech answer to a human problem! But, in Fake News, there are backslashes with already more pernicious consequences: Journalists&#8217; self-censorship or the fact that news are no more about truth or fake but it is more a matter of belief than anything else!</p>

To make it short, last year, I was asked by a friend to apply web scrapping in a competitors’ spying campaign. I should say Business Intelligence, it is more corporate and politically correct! Anyway, it does not surprise me so much that learning Testing, Automation and Python will lead me to this area partially included in Surveillance Capitalism Phenomenon.

<li>It has become tremendously easy to &#8220;hijack&#8221; or divert technologies from their first uses to make a Surveillance Swiss Army Knife even for an absolute beginner like me.</li>
<li>Learning is rewarding but practising is even better. With this usecase, I was suddenly no longer facing theory but a complex reality. I took it as an opportunity to test my solving problem capability. That was a true exercise to practice what I have just learned (Python mostly).</li>
</ol>
<p><b>Hope that this quick and mundane introduction did not have a chilling effect on you! Here is some commands and scripts about Web scraping, all in Python. I have purposely excluded the things made with NLP or using JavaScript End to End Testing Framework such as CodeceptJS or Cypress that are beyond the scope of this post.</b></p>

<h3>Some elements about Web Scraping</h3>
<p>Here are various examples that automate the browser usage in order to get a map on Google Map or perform a search on Google, or download and save file. I made some attempts to grab HTML content with the help of BeautifulSoup, so all filenames with the pattern: slurpThatSoup_1.py, slurpThatSoup_2.py&#8230; are handling a BeautifulSoup Object from HTML</p>
<p>FYI, BeautifulSoup (bs4) is one of the best Web Scraping library in Python is BeautifulSoup. You can find more on the official websites and documentation.</p>

</ol>
<p>As a huge supporter of testing, I made an extended usage of selenium Module to control the Browser, leveraging on Selenium’s WebDriver Methods to Finding HTML Elements.<br />
<b>Even so, it is sometime easier to divert testing frameworks such as CodeceptJS to perform actions in browser instead of using Selenium.</b></p>

<p>Like I said at the beginning of this post. The starting idea was simple, how can I aleviate real-world tasks such as: </p>
<ol>
<li>Improve the user feedback loop (monitoring user feedback or converting static FAQs to a modest User Support Conversational Agent).</li>
<li>Text understanding to enable meaningfull keywords extraction or text summary for instance.</li>
</ol>
<p>I found some very contrived examples and some more advanced ones like always. Even though, these examples are oversimplified, there are still caveats for less technical readers, including me, especially when it comes to concepts pertaining to linguistic eg stemming, tokenization, tokenizer, bag of words or Convolutional Neural Network.</p>
<p>I invite to check these very intuitive videos that are good introduction to NLP.</p>
<p>These videos are giving some enlightening on NLP&#8217;s concepts such as stemming, tokenization, tokenizer or bag of words or even some explanations on different type of IA’s network such as Convolutional Neural Network and the way to use it.</p>

<h2>Some critics about IA</h2>
<p>Let&#8217;s step back a little bit to think a minute about IA consequences. These IA tools exerts an undeniable fascination. Why? These are new tools that actually begin to think and act on its own. The idea that these tools will make decisions and undertake actions on their own is fascinating and scary at the same time. I was wondering if any critical thinking existed towards the deafening consensus on AI?<br />
I found some opponents, on a philosophical point of view. Even though, IA fanatics report that the AI promise is to &#8220;Humanize the machine, not mechanize the User&#8221;, the main critic remains the AI&#8217;s &#8220;injunctive power&#8221;. Combined with consent, it makes an unstoppable combination to turn us mankind into passive and obedient sheeps! By the way, the GAFAS, that promote IA, never really assumed they were the bad guy.</p>
<p>Indeed, IA can been seen as the ultimate market achievement where, reduced as consumers, we only take decisions with utilitarian goals, &#8220;obeying&#8221; to IA.</p>
<p>Regarding NLP, the disturbing thing is the familiar form that this injunction takes. The Chatbot speaks to you, the NLP writes and advises you with your own words&#8230; This is step forward to a very persuasive soft power. So, is the very idea of rebelling still even exist as it sounds ludicrous, to fight with a friend!</p>
<p>What I mostly remember from this reading:<br />
&#8211; IA is a threat to humanity, especially our free will.<br />
&#8211; IA is the ultimate version of &#8220;Invisible hand&#8221;, so criticizing IA seems to be the way to &#8220;burn down&#8221; the system aka capitalism, GAFAS (Facebook, Google, Amazon&#8230; etc. that are mostly behind the IA libraries and expect something in return: your datas so you can be profiled.</p>
<p>Even though it is nowadays almost impossible to avoid IA, that&#8217;s always good to read opinions against the mainstream way of thinking so you’ll be aware of the potential IA’s threats!</p>

<h2>What&#8217;s next? How can I use NLP?</h2>
<p>I wonder more and more if the target has not become to even drop PHP to build a web application. Is refactoring a PHP legacy Code in Python is an option?</p>
<p>Indeed, building a web application, I do not even talk about a website seems to be easy nowadays. You can gather an effective SPA (Single Page Application) in a very short time but providing meaningful and advanced features for a CMS is much trickier! </p>
<p>To be totally transparent, a simple question is spinning around in my head: How can I add some &#8220;intelligent&#8221; functionalities, using these Python libraries, to an existing CMS made in PHP (Laravel or Symfony for instance)? Apparently, the way seems to build a separate API in Python that will brigde with PHP!</p>
<p>Like I said in my previous post, these NLP libraries are not only enabling new tasks to be made but these libraries can even carry out tasks like a real human such as me a P.O for a Backoffice! Great, I am outsourcing myself.</p>
<h2>Using Anaconda</h2>
<p>A reminder for useful commands with Anaconda</p>
<pre lang=""bash"">
# Check Anaconda installation
conda --version

# Update conda
conda update -n base -c defaults conda

# Create an environment
# environment with Python 3.5
conda create --name myEnvironmentOne python=3.5

# launch a script named 006_nltk_cookbook_test.py
--- python 006_nltk_cookbook_test.py

# Get into the env named myEnvironmentOne
conda activate myEnvironmentOne

# get out from an env
conda deactivate

# By default you are in the base env no need to activate
# conda activate base
</pre>
<h2>In conclusion</h2>
<p>This reading gave me an overview of the Python&#8217;s possibilities in terms of text understanding. NLP seems to be progressing more and more every day and remains fairly accessible if you do not pretend to be a specialist! It would be a shame to do without it while waiting to see progress in text&#8217;s generation with BERT for example.</p>
<p><b> To remove doubts about the NLP&#8217;s potential, this post underwent both a keyword extraction and summarization operations with the help of 2 scripts given here as example. The result is not bad! It is a true crutch for a rookie journalist like me! You can see below the result.</b></p>

18,"Improve a CMS’s photos library qualification with AI, facial recognition in python, to provide better images search results to users",1,"<p>My last post was a modest attempt in discovering Python potential with the help of Anaconda. Meanwhile, Artificial Intelligence (AI) was bewitched me 🙂 So, I gained confidence using Python in order to explore AI librairies such as NTLK, OpenCV or face_recognition from ageitgey (Adam Geitgey).</p>
<p><a href=""https://github.com/bflaven/BlogArticlesExamples/tree/master/python_playing_with_facial_recognition"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"">You can find the files in my github account More on https://github.com/bflaven/BlogArticlesExamples/ in python_playing_with_facial_recognition</a></p>
<p><b>This post is about a real issue that can be solved by IA. I believe that for any technical topic, rather than exploring AI documentation which in itself could be quite wastful. I always strive to tackle a real use case and apply as much as possible what I want to discover.</b></p>
<p>So, applying this principle, I have spotted facial recognition for pictures. Like many, I am iOS mobile Phone user and I saw facial recognition at work. I start to wonder: &#8220;How can apply those facial recognition principles in a backoffice?&#8221;. As I am currently a PO for a Backoffice, I am supposed to have a clear &#8220;vision&#8221; of my product but more than that I know perfectly its weaknesses, especially dealing with pictures.</p>
<p>The benefit of this simple question allows me not to stress about the details right away and instead quickly jot something down as a placeholder for a conversation between me, myself and I, a soliloquy. The intent was to not forget to ask all the right questions either upfront or somewhere down the road but do not prevent from starting a P.O.C.</p>
<p>Here is my shortlist that highlights some of the functional and nonfunctional concerns or requirements that I wanted to address. This list has driven all my decisions to obtain a pragmatic result without missing the goal.</p>
<p><b>Goal:</b> How can apply those facial recognition principles in a Backoffice  in order to improve image search results at the end?</p>
<p><b>Short actions todolist:</b></p>
<ol>
<li>Browse unknown people images directory with Facial Recognition Script</li>
<li>Detect known people faces among these images set them aside</li>
<li>Insert these known people images in a MySQL database</li>
</ol>
<p><b>Requirement:</b> This Spike will be all made in Python but I do not want to end up with an overzealous shopping list of requirements.</p>
<p>Let me explain the situation. In the Backoffice, which I am dealing with, is hosting thousand of &#8220;unqualified&#8221; images that contains faces of:  Donald Trump, Xi Jinping, Angela Merkel, Boris Johnson, Emmanuel Macron, Vladimir Poutine, Recep Tayyip Erdoğan or less kwnown poeple in an european centric point of view: Macky Sall, Rodrigo Duterte, Ramzan Kadyrov, Hun Sen, Narendra Modi, Hassan Rohani, Stevo Pendarovski, Nicolás Maduro, Edgar Lungu&#8230;</p>
<p><b>Remember that we still need a human intelligence to say who is who? For your information, Stevo Pendarovski, Стево Пендаровски, is president of North Macedonia, holding the office since 12 May 2019 and he looks a bit like me 🙂 or that is just the glasses.</b></p>
<p><b>The face of Stevo Pendarovski, Стево Пендаровски, president of North Macedonia</b><br />
<img loading=""lazy"" class=""aligncenter"" src=""http://flaven.fr/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/facial_recognition_stevo_pendarovski.jpeg"" alt=""Improve a CMS's photos library qualification with AI, facial recognition in python, to provide better images search results to users"" width=""585"" height=""330"" /></p>
<p><b>The idea is to increase the relevance of research and reduce the sample of images that will be retrieved with a traditionnal textual search based on their name. It will save time, money and resources but also improve user experience. So, user do not get no results at all or improper results in his/her image search.</b></p>
<p>The fact, no one wants to qualify each image by opening them one after the other, adding correct caption to improve indexation and by consequence future&#8217;s search results. We are talking about more than 1 500 000 pictures. Indeed, the wise choice is to leave it to a computer. </p>
<p>This is where the &#8220;US cavalry&#8221; comes to the rescue in the person of facial recognition library. This library will give you an easy way to detect known faces e.g. list of current state leaders, across all these images.</p>
<p>The machine learning is here for that and there are tons of pre-trained models and ready to go libraries that you can use. With this magic wand, you properly scale up your skills and impress your friends or your mother. &#8220;Look mummy, I am a data scientist!&#8221;.</p>
<p>As the facial recognition library will truly analyzed the images, it will prevent you to mix up images search with common namesake or word-sense disambiguation. For instance, you can make a difference between Michelle and Barack Obama or if you type Bush and you are looking for the 2 former US presidents, you won&#8217;t get australian bush&#8217;s pictures.</p>
<p>At the end, as a collateral &#8220;damage&#8221;, when the requalification will be impleteted in the media database, you&#8217;ll be able to improve the UX by adding a filter named such as &#8220;Portrait&#8221; in source selection dropdown menu. Menu that already contains filters like Editorial, Broadcast, Press agency and let the user select source for his/her images search.</p>
<p><b>One last thing, on an historical point of view, what conclusion can we draw from this allegedly harmless experience?</b></p>
<p>In the last century, robotization has replaced blue-collar workers in an automobile assembly line for instance. Let&#8217;s say ending mass employment in the  first industrial revolution industries. What about our nowadays industries? I guess that IA will certainly replace human intelligence e.g. white-collar workers for tedious and repetitive administrative works such as writing meeting minutes, sorting pictures, sorting documents, answering to questions&#8230;. and maybe even more creative works! </p>
<p>As I speak to you, it is no more a dystopia! IA is creeping everywhere. Exception made in some companies where people are still working like in caveman age. In this case, the purpose here is to &#8220;buy social peace&#8221; by keeping obsolete jobs alive! Well, sooner or later, there will be an arbitration between some of your job&#8217;s tasks and their possible carry out by Artificial Intelligence (AI). Is there a name for this phenomenon? Anyway, you&#8217;ll be facing soon this &#8220;intelligentization&#8221; or &#8220;artificialization&#8221; of your job so you&#8217;d better be ready! I do not even mention the IA’s usage especially facial recognition in surveillance and security that is already a standard!</p>
<p><b>Never forget that modern capitalism loves creative destruction and see AI as a disrupting factor in many industries. This is such a growing question that there&#8217;s even a website called, &#8220;Will Robots Take My Job?&#8221;. The website&#8217;s name speaks for itself. You can look up a job title and see the its likelihood of AI-driven doom. <a href=""https://willrobotstakemyjob.com/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"">https://willrobotstakemyjob.com/</a></b></p>
<p>But, let&#8217;s come back to our user story, playing with facial recognition in a very inoffensive way !</p>
<p>First, I need to have Anaconda install, see previous post for the installation instructions: <a href=""http://flaven.fr/2020/05/python-anaconda-worpress-json-json-schema-messy-post-with-few-practices-and-feedback-from-my-p-o-experience/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"">http://flaven.fr/2020/05/python-anaconda-worpress-json-json-schema-messy-post-with-few-practices-and-feedback-from-my-p-o-experience/</a></p>

</ul>
<p><b>Here are few useful instructions to handle MySQL in the console.</b></p>
<p><b>1. Add MySQL to $PATH</b></p>
<pre lang=""bash"">
sudo -s 
vi /etc/paths
vi $HOME/.bash_profile
export PATH=$PATH:/usr/local/mysql/bin
source $HOME/.bash_profile
</pre>
<p><b>2. Using the MySQL shortcut in the console to connect to MySQL</b></p>
<pre lang=""bash"">
mysql -u root -p
# equivalent to /usr/local/mysql/bin/mysql -u root -p 
</pre>
<p><b>3. Instructions to connect MySQL to Sequel Pro</b><br />
It is to prevent a possible error with Sequel Pro and MySQL 8.0 on Mac.</p>
<p>1. Open MySQL from System Preferences > Initialize Database ><br />
2. Type your new password.<br />
3. Choose &#8216;Use legacy password&#8217;<br />
4. Start the Server again.<br />
5. Now connect Sequel Pro</p>
<p><b>For the step 5, you must have the credentials for Sequel Pro: root password for MySQL and the ip address of the MySQL server <i>127.0.0.1</i>.</b></p>

<h2>Installation and configuration for MySQL Python</h2>
<p>There are different ways to install MySQL-python. One is using Pip, the other is using Anaconda.</p>
<p><b>1. To check your anancoda version in the console.</b></p>
<pre lang=""bash"">
$ conda --version
</pre>
<p><b>2. If needed upgrade pip</b></p>
<pre lang=""bash"">
$ pip install --upgrade pip
</pre>
<p><b>3. To install the mysql-connector-python package, type the following command.</b></p>
<pre lang=""bash"">
$ pip install mysql-connector-python # way_1
$ conda install mysql-connector-python # way_2
</pre>
<p><b>4. To install the pymysql package, type the following command.</b></p>
<pre lang=""bash"">
$ pip install pymysql # way_1
$ conda install pymysql # way_2
</pre>
<p><b>5. Let&#8217;s install facial recognition in order to sort pictures. I tried with Homebrew but it did not work for me so I decided to go with Pip. Here is the other way to install face_recognition with PIP.</b></p>
<pre lang=""bash"">
sudo -s
$ pip install --upgrade pip
$ pip install cmake
$ pip install dlib
$ pip install face_recognition
$ pip install opencv-python
</pre>
<p><b>6. It is good to verify the installation of face_recognition with PIP and some other stuff by doing so.</b></p>
<pre lang=""bash"">
# Verify face_recognition install
# go into the console and call python
$ python

# The output shoud be the following
# Python 2.7.14 |Anaconda, Inc.| (default, Oct  5 2017, 02:28:52) [GCC 4.2.1 Compatible Clang 4.0.1 (tags/RELEASE_401/final)] on darwin Type ""help"", ""copyright"", ""credits"" or ""license"" for more information.
</pre>
<p><b>7. You can call the librariries and if get no errors, you are good to go.</b></p>
<pre lang=""python"">
>>> import dlib
>>> import face_recognition
>>> import cv2
>>> exit ()
</pre>
<h2>Let&#8217;s face the problem&#8230;</h2>
<p><b>I will probably do a video to see how to manipulate the files. Like always, the most difficult part of the facial recognition is to have installed the correct environment. The rest is easy as 1,2,3. The idea to inject in a MySQL database is to easily retrieve the results and also if you needed to extend the database to insert a set of credits, legends, captions&#8230; and so on. Then, you can just identify differences and produce some helpful statistics and so finally update the real media databases with correct elements to improve textual search.</b></p>
<p>You can browse files from my GitHub account, the scripts and filenames are self-explanatory.</p>
<pre lang=""bash"">
# get to the dir where you will execute the script

cd /path-to-your-dir/python_face_recognition_mysql/

16,"Python, Randomization, E2E – it’s all about Random and some good reasons to learn and leverage on Python",1,"<p>Order is a very relative notion, it is specific for each of us. &#8220;The world is my representation&#8221; as Arthur &#8220;Chop&#8221; Schopenhauer says.  At the same time, experience teaches us &#8220;Every cloud has a silver lining&#8221; so modestly I discovered that a relative &#8220;disorder&#8221; is often more efficient than an absolute &#8220;order&#8221;. Right? Ooh slow down a bit! It is not an easy-peasy Q/A!</p>
<p>For sure, you can ask yourself why such interrogations are part of a so called post dedicated to Python. Well, first of all, it make sense for me for several reasons:</p>
<p>Never bad to introduce some philosophy in programming practice. Personally, it reconciles two of my favorite hobbies (bad programming &#038; cheap philosophy) to one : headache! More serioulsy, these thoughts come from a practical and real-world experience.</p>
<p>Let me tell you the story: after a long, long aging process, as a PO, I achieved to build a robust testing strategy with CodeceptJS for a backoffice! But then I discovered that the e2e sequential execution of the suite created a bias (let&#8217;s called them errors). OMG! Then I was wondering how to introduce randomization inside the testing suite execution in order to reduce this bias to the maximum. The purpose is to avoid the false positive nightmare!</p>
<p>Meanwhile, in a completely chaotic, confused, disordered, disorganised, topsy-turvy, helter-skelter, pell-mell, upside-down, higgledy-piggledy, hugger-mugger, harum-scarum, snafu, slipshod, unplanned, erratic, strayed, hit-and-miss, incidental, spontaneous, uncoordinated, willy-nilly, devil-may-care, unpremeditated, reckless, cockeyed, hit-and-miss, fluky, incidental&#8230; anarchic way, I am learning advanced Python techniques (NLP, facial recognition &#8230;) but also fundamentals like the difference between a &#8220;tuple&#8221; and a &#8220;dictionnary&#8221;. <b>So it was logic that Python popped up in my mind to bring this randomness, given the complexity of doing the same thing in Bash, a language that I am far from mastering!</b></p>
<p><b>Incidentally, this experiment proves me that Python is: </b> </p>
<ul>
<li><b>Easy to read:</b> Python is easy to read and most of the language makes sense at a glimpse. This makes finding issues a lot easier than more complicated languages.</li>
<li><b>Portability:</b> Python runs on many platforms and systems, meaning your programs can reach a wider audience. It can easily replace Bash or Ruby of instance.</li>
</ul>
<p>Two qualities that gave Python a serious advantage in what I am looking for: to create on-demand order or disorder 🙂</p>
<ul>
<li>Order: when it comes to browsing, summarizing and indexing hundreds of texts in order to store them in a database itself MySQL and/or NoSQL.</li>
<li>Disorder: when it comes to run tests in parallel, for example, and thereby overcome a bias linked to a sequential execution.</li>
</ul>
<p><b>Oddly, sometimes, Disorder proves to be more efficient and effective than Order.</b></p>
<p>So, this post presents my quick researches on how-to handle random in Python. Having in mind that the final objective is to load randomly testing files that achieve a complete Backoffice&#8217;s assessment without increasing errors into the process.</p>
<p><b>By the way, it reveals a third and fourth Python qualities:</b> </p>
<ul>
<li><b>Increasing productivity:</b> how much work you can accomplish in a given time with few lines of code.</li>
<li><b>Relieving Boring Stuff in Bullshit Jobs:</b> Thanks to Al Sweigart and David Graeber to have enabled me to create this &#8220;tuna-mayo-sandwich&#8221; concept.</li>
</ul>
<p>So, now, let&#8217;s move on and show some code&#8230;</p>
<h2>The code for this POC</h2>
<p>A mix of files that show some concepts explained above. Most of them should end to the bin but sometimes I need to refresh my own memory so I made up a post with it.</p>

<h2>Which Python ?</h2>
<p>Most of the time I am using python from Anaconda but from now on, I started to use: </p>
<ol>
<li>Python distributed (python2) with Mac</li>
<li>but also another Python (python3) installed with the help of Homebrew</li>
</ol>
<p>The fact that Python replace my poor Bash notions and enable me to scale up at the same time my abilities to do things and speed up my Python&#8217;s learning process. For instance, the python&#8217;s ability to randomize or shuffle elements is very easy to catch and then code. So, my idea was to launch a bash (.bat, yes I am sometime on Windows) that launch a Python script (.py) that will launch a random shuffle of CPJS scripts e2e suite (a bunch of .js files). Russian doll game for PO.</p>
<p>There are plenty of resources about this Python version issue. I always forget to note down precisely what was helpful and what was not. Anyway, when you&#8217;ll be handling to Python versions on your computer, you may find useful these commands.</p>
<pre lang=""bash"">

# Some commands to determine the Python's version

python --version
# Output: Python 2.7.10
which python
# /usr/bin/python


python3 --version
# Output: Python 3.7.7
which python3
# /usr/local/bin/python3


# So, you can decide to execute your Python script whether with the version 2 or 3 of Python.

python3 myscript_in_python.py

python myscript_in_python.py

</pre>
<p>The other thing is that I am not always writting in english so I have start to use only Python 3 as Python 3 come by default in UTF-8 and declare also the encoding. Period.</p>
<pre lang=""python"">
#!/usr/bin/python
