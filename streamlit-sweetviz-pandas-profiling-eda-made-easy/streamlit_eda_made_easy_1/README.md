# streamlit_eda_made_easy_1

**On GitHub, you can find different approach to build up an "Exploratory Data Analysis" (EDA in Data Science). This one is inspired by Marina Ramalhete from Brazil that is pretty advanced as is it designed with a Class. I have rework few elements to make it more readable and deliver more contextual information when checking the data.**


Most of the values are in a file named `values_conf.py`
```bash
config_values/values_conf.py
```
