# streamlit_eda_made_easy_sweetviz_3
**All my knowledge came from this article coderzcolumn.com: [https://coderzcolumn.com/tutorials/data-science/sweetviz-automate-exploratory-data-analysis-eda](https://coderzcolumn.com/tutorials/data-science/sweetviz-automate-exploratory-data-analysis-eda). Again, I strongly invite you to read this article that is the best I have found on the web. I have just extended some elements from this article by giving some information and migrate the all stuff presented into Streamlit framework.**



Most of the values are in a file named `values_conf.py`
```bash
config_values/values_conf.py
```
