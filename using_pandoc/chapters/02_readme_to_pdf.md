# Example of readme
This is our text.

This is another paragraph.

We can use Markdown for figures and images

Markdown for lists

* One
* Two
    * Nested one
* Three
    1. Numerated list
    1. No need to specify number

We can even inline math: $y = ax + b$.  
How about displayed equations:

$$
y = -2.2x + 0.5
$$

## Subsection
Just use Markdown to define sections and structure of the document.

Let's finish with a footnote.[^3]
