> Inertia is our enemy as a consequence: if change is hard, make it continuous; Everybody is entitles to their own opinion, but... A shared opinion is a fact; it is not fail fast, fail often... It is learn fast and learn often.






### 2. The Law of Two Feet
The mention is often this one: Follow your feet or the law of two feet.

> Take care of yourself and know how to move when you no longer learn anything or you no longer contribute in order to value your time and that of others.


In details, the original defition is thes follwing. From Open Space Technology: A user's guide by Harrison Owens

> If you are in a discussion group and you are neither learning nor contributing, your knowledge and energy are too important to us to have it wasted. Use the Law of Two Feet to take yourself to where you are learning or contributing. You have ways of being mobile, use those ways so that you can get the best benefit from this experience, and so the others can get the best benefit from you. You might end up being like a butterfly and alighting somewhere not seeming to do anything, but we trust that you are in exactly the right place to be learning or contributing. You might be like a bumblebee and go from group to group to group, cross-pollinating many discussions. We trust that it is exactly right for you to be moving frequently as you choose how you learn and contribute. With all of us using the Law of Two Feet, we respect that this is an important behavior to get the greatest benefit during an OST meeting. At no time is anyone's knowledge or energy wasted when we all pay attention to this law.
