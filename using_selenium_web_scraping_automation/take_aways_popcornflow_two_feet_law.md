**Some take-aways on Popcorn Flow and The Law of Two Feet**


## I. PopcornFlow

**Popcorn Flow by Claudio Perrone**

> Inertia is our enemy as a consequence: if change is hard, make it continuous; Everybody is entitles to their own opinion, but... A shared opinion is a fact; it is not fail fast, fail often... It is learn fast and learn often.


**The observation:** Everyone knows that change is difficult. In work more than elsewhere, it is always extremely complex to get rid of habits.


### A. PRINCIPLES


#### PRINCIPLE #1 PopcornFlow :: The virus of change


In order to become familiar with change management


- As change is difficult, it must be made continuous.
- By dint of repetition, training, it becomes easy to apprehend and transform change into a series of non-events. Indeed, the more a thing is repeated, the less we will pay attention!


**The important thing is the process, not necessarily the result, even if the objective pursued is success. Our actions do not convey values, everything goes through action otherwise we are left with a declaration of principle.**


Toyota's Anedocte :: "What they need to see is not visible." Kanban, Value Stream Mapping, 5S are only apparent solutions. Toyota's results is a thought process, not the thought itself.


**All solutions are good, but not for everyone. Indeed, it is essential to understand the process that has enabled others to define a practice. A solution is nothing other than the result of a reflection applied in a given context. So, be careful before copying practices whitout defining the context. It's not what you do but what you learn by doing that matters.**

*Possible limit :: Reforming the system is almost impossible. No doubt that by correcting the errors, we influence the system but very marginally. In any case reforming the system should be a declared objective (Taqîya).*

*Possible critic :: May have a social cost. The untold idea behind is to weaken people (team for instance) and treat each member as individual. By breaking solidarity and isolating everyone, team become in fact much more manipulable. No one in the group or team will protest if someone is ostracized, isolated and unsupported. It can serve more a management objective than one for team building.*


#### PRINCIPLE #2 PopcornFlow :: The urgency of continuous improvement (kaizen)



Le concept de l'inertie est le deuxième principe popcornflow. Notre plus grand ennemi c'est une tendance naturelle à ne rien faire ou à ne pas changer.


L'énormité du changement à accomplir nous dissuade d'agir, la tendance naturelle est le statu-quo. Rester dans une situation inconfortable mais connue.

Il faut sans doute se désaxer et regarder les effets que le changement produit plutôt que le changement lui-même.


On n'a pas besoin d'avoir une information parfaite pour pouvoir commencer à progresser ? La validation ou l'invalidation passe par la pratique.

Tout le monde a le droit d'avoir une opinion, mais... une opinion partagée est un fait.

L'idée est donc de partager son opinion sur un élément que l'on pense devoir être amélioré à l'équipe. Si l'équipe partage cette opinion, alors on peut la considérer comme un fait et commencer à traiter le problème. En effet, au lieu de passer des heures à analyser pour savoir si le problème est bien un problème, expérimentons ! Permettons-nous d'avoir une hypothèse imparfaite, peut-être que nous convergerons ensemble sur un résultat qui nous conviendra à tous !

#### PRINCIPLE #3 PopcornFlow :: The skateboarder

Can we really claim that we will never fail? How else can we view failure? Of course, to relativize the scope of failure, we must highlight the value of learning.

As long as you don't learn anything from your failure. This is the purpose of the retrospective in an agile management mode. An event whose value and scope is not always well applied or understood because it involves doing a reasonable and sincere examination of what happened in the last sprint.

**So, the principle is no longer exactly "Fail Fast, Fail Cheap" but more "Learn Fast, Learn Often" you even try the "Learn Fast, Learn Cheap".**

*Possible limit :: Primacy given to action which remains the best way to learn, however your life is not infinitely expandable. This is one of the reasons why the society of the permanent present shuns death like the plague. Imagination, contemplation and therefore the art of "fare niente" are rarely promoted. These values seem incompatible to create an entrepreneur mindset. From there to value the non-thought... :)*


### B. THE PROCESS

#### 1. Issues & Observations
- First step, it is necessary to identify the problems or the points of improvement.
- Converge on shared problems: as a team we must find problems that are unanimous within a team.
- In any case, the improvement's implementation will necessarily cost time and money.
- The agreement can be made on a "false" or "imperfect" postulate but it must win the whole team's support. This is a fact, a "corner stone" on which the whole team agrees since it must initially be only a working hypothesis in order to push us to action.

Ex: UAT tests do not exist, tickets are elusive, backlog management is time-consuming, no quality objective... etc.


#### 2. Options


You have to force yourself to find 3 possible options or solutions to solve the problem.

> "Having a choice is not a choice; having two choices is a dilemma; and having three choices opens up new possibilities." 
> *Virginia Satir*


**The Rule Of Three**

Before deciding on a course of action, come up with three alternatives. Here are three ways of thinking about The Rule Of Three. 

- (i). Family therapist Virginia Satir encouraged people to have at least three choices. She said: ... to have one choice is no choice; to have two choices is a dilemma; and to have three choices offers new possibilities. – The Satir Model, Virginia Satir
s
- (ii). Jerry Weinberg : If you can't think of three things that might go wrong with your plans, then there's something wrong with your thinking. 

- (iii). One more formulation: If you don’t have three options for a solution to a problem, you don’t understand it well enough yet, and you might need to explore it more.

#### 3. Possible experiments
Based on the options, experiments are defined to explore them. This is a crucial step because you gave yourself as a team the chance to explore your options. We link with the well-known Build-Measure-Learn Feedback Loop from Lean Startup.

Ex: "Let's have a team meeting every morning", "Let's do Pair Programming for 3 days"

#### 4. Commitment or Committed

We must be committed in full transparency :) That is the agile motto. Remember that agile's values Transparency and Commitment

- (i) Transparency
Without full transparency there are lots of bad things that happen, including:

	+ Lack of trust with the Product Owner
	+ Team has to get caught-up in politics instead of focusing on what needs to be delivered
	+ Team morale can suffer
	+ Measuring future work is more difficult
	+ The team’s true velocity is not known


- (ii) Commitment

With respect to Scrum, commitment means the Scrum Team is devoted to achieving a specific goal. The Scrum Team members commit to collaborate with each other and learn to do the best in every activity.

	+ They commit to the Product Goal and the Sprint Goal; and look for continuous improvements. 
	+ They stay committed to Agile values and principles, and Scrum practices. 
	+ And they commit to complete the work within time, ensure transparency, and challenge each other the status quo and move towards continuous improvement.


**Committed, e.g. doing everything possible to implement the options chosen and guarantee learning. Expectations must also be quantitatively or qualitatively measurable and answer the question: did it work?**


#### 4. Ongoing
It is show time! The time has come for practice.

#### 5. Review
Arrived at the review date, we take stock of the results of the experiment by comparing what we obtained with what we expected or hoped for.

Here are the types of questions you can ask yourself:

- What experiments did we plan to do?
- What did we actually do?
- What did we expect to happen?
- What really happened?
- What have we learned?

**Note: This can also be done as part of retrospectives.**


#### 6. Next
Based on what we learned, what are we going to do next?

Several options are then available to us:

The results are not obvious, maybe it deserves to be extended for X days/weeks!
Let's re-evaluate our options!
Let's re-evaluate our experiments!
Choose new experiments!
Are there others that we hadn't thought of before?
Let's re-evaluate our problem!


#### 7. Why does it work?
PopcornFlow helps people engage with their issues rather than just talking about them.

This is another way to visualize and materialize ideas/problems in this case by writing them on Post-its and moving them on a board. PopcornFlow works when there is a desire to learn and improve. The question is no longer to do or not to do something but rather to choose the option that seems best to us!

- It's not what you do but what you learn by doing that matters. More it is what you do with what you learn that matters! Above the learning by doing, it is what you do with what you learn that matters.

## II. The Law of Two Feet
**The mention is often this one: Follow your feet or the law of two feet.**

> Take care of yourself and know how to move when you no longer learn anything or you no longer contribute in order to value your time and that of others.


In details, the original defition is thes follwing. From Open Space Technology: A user's guide by Harrison Owens

> If you are in a discussion group and you are neither learning nor contributing, your knowledge and energy are too important to us to have it wasted. Use the Law of Two Feet to take yourself to where you are learning or contributing. You have ways of being mobile, use those ways so that you can get the best benefit from this experience, and so the others can get the best benefit from you. You might end up being like a butterfly and alighting somewhere not seeming to do anything, but we trust that you are in exactly the right place to be learning or contributing. You might be like a bumblebee and go from group to group to group, cross-pollinating many discussions. We trust that it is exactly right for you to be moving frequently as you choose how you learn and contribute. With all of us using the Law of Two Feet, we respect that this is an important behavior to get the greatest benefit during an OST meeting. At no time is anyone's knowledge or energy wasted when we all pay attention to this law.
